### Background and Objectives
Labor is an act that inevitably accompanies human life. Compared to rapid economic growth, workers' working conditions have not improved noticeably. In the working environment, individual values were decreasing, and they were often not properly respected. Among them, the labor vulnerable groups are prone to discrimination in the labor market and are not guaranteed legitimate rights. Even in the current job market, they are marginalized. In order to promote steady economic growth in the future, securing workers' rights must be a priority.

We divided the problems of the working environment into four categories and focused on the conflicts and solutions that may arise between employers and workers.

- overdue wages

Workers may not be properly paid, such as delayed deposit dates or not guaranteed minimum hourly wages. **The value of their work should be appropriately compensated.

- exploitation of labor

During office hours, individuals are sometimes assigned heavy workloads. As a result, workers are placed in busy and poor working conditions. **Follows working hours, lunch hours, and commuting hours.

- unfair dismissal

If a worker is fired for no good reason, it becomes difficult to make a living right away. Workers should be notified of their dismissal in advance and fully prepared for the future. Likewise, employers should not be notified of workers' sudden departure.

- abuse

Workers are treated unfairly for a variety of reasons while on duty. Even if you go through something unfair, you don't know how to deal with it, so you move on. ** Wages differences based on gender, race, disability and unfair working conditions should be improved. In addition, both employers and workers need active attention and effort to solve the problem.

Our service provides quality jobs that improve the existing poor working conditions, helping to prevent the value of workers from falling. In addition, considering the position of the employer, it enables better work management and job hunting. Through this, workers are provided with better jobs, and employers aim to create a labor market that is satisfactory to everyone by finding the right workers for the workplace.

### Target
We aim to support and empower vulnerable groups in the labor market, including foreign workers (especially women), the elderly, people with disabilities, teenagers, and immigrants. Our sub-target is individuals seeking employment.

While there are existing job search platforms that connect employers and workers, there is a lack of applications specifically targeting vulnerable labor groups. Sainz, however, goes beyond basic job hunting functions and aims to provide workers with reasonable treatment in the appropriate working environment. This includes features such as labor contract management, commute tracking, rest time guarantees, and vacation planning. Additionally, Sainz offers guidance on how to deal with workplace unfairness, ensuring that workers' rights are secured.

To address the lack of labor education, Sainz provides educational videos on topics such as workers' human rights, safety, disability, and sexual harassment. Users can earn badges based on their viewing activity, which contribute to their reliability score. Unlike other platforms that typically only evaluate workers, Sainz includes employer evaluations in the reliability score, leading to the formation of high-quality labor jobs based on mutual trust between both parties.

Finally, recognizing the lack of community support for business owners, Sainz operates separately from the worker and employer communities.
